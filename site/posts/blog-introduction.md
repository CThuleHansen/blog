Finally I got around to starting a blog. I have been wanting to do this for ages but not found the time.
This will mainly concern Haskell but might delve into other areas related to programming that I find interesting.

A brief recap of my Haskell Journey:
I first encountered Haskell during my Masters in software engineering. It interested me a lot, probably because of the clear correspondence to theory and the alternative way of writing software when coming from a regular C#/C++ OO-approach.
But the main reasons were (and still are): It presents a challenge, and I love the idea of making illegal states unrepresentable.

I touched Haskell a bit back then, and then started my PhD, where I did not touch much Haskell. In the end I got around to writing a small backend for website along with a frontend in Elm. Then my progress stalled again, and now I finally got around to doing a bit of Haskell on the side. It is however difficult to find time, as I now have three children < 6 years old.

During the long on/off period I touched upon different blogs, books, exercises and so forth, but it does not motivate me as much anymore. Instead, I was hoping to contribute to some sort of open-source tooling that would accept my unstable contributions and help me get into non-toy-example Haskell. I reached out to Dmitrii Kovanikov (https://twitter.com/ChShersh) and he was very welcoming (Thank you!) and had the perfect fit for my interests: Iris (https://github.com/chshersh/iris). Hopefully my first pull-request will be merged in soon after several rounds of massaging. 

I hope to frequently find the time to write some posts and who knows, I might one day be able to introduce Haskell in my job as well.
