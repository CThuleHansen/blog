description: Templates for typical and necessary parts of an application
---

My current goal of Haskell learning is to generate templates for different typical parts of an application:
- JSON/YAML parsing and writing
- Error Reporting including:
  - Logging to file
- Passing Environment
- State-handling
- CRUD
- Database access
- CLI options
- Testing
- Network Communication
- CI for Haskell
- My GHC options
- Something with concurrency. Ideas?
